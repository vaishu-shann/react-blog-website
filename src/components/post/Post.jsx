                  I find ways to seek your attention
                  and to be honest, I feel so good
                  when you bestow the bestest kind
                  of love to me through the warmth
                  of your arms. I feel so much secured
                  and so much loved. You give me
                  peace that my heart craves for the
                  most. Nothing in this world can
                  understand me the way you do.
                  My bad days gets a shine and I get
                  a ray of hope through the way you
                  help me out and tell me things gonna
                  be okay. You have always stood by me
                  whenever I needed you, in everyday
                  life and my toughest times as well.
                  You are the reason I smile, even when
                  I don’t want to or even when I am sad.
                  My happy times gets better with you.
                  Nothing in this world, I seek for more
                  than your love and the warmth you
                  give me. I hope, this love that we have
                  remains the same until my last breath.

      It hurts cause when you told me the first time that you were in love with me, you knew you were not, but you still pretended that you had fallen for me, exactly like the sun falls for the moon to occupy the evening skies.

      It hurts cause when I fell for you like a child falls in love with his bedtime stories and lullabies, you kept leading me on and on, as if this would go way beyond forever – when you knew that all I was going to be in the end was a pile of debris.


      It hurts cause when I told you that I was hurt and you could see that I was hurt and you knew that I was hurt because of you, all you ever told me in that moment was that I was being extra, that I was overwhelming – when you knew that you had overwhelmed me with ignorance and suffering.


      It hurts cause you knew that I loved you like I was breathing; like there was no other alternative to it and you still gave me reasons to give up – even when you knew what giving up on breathing ends up in.


      It hurts cause I clenched on to words – words that were sometimes poems, other days letters, and sometimes there were no words at all – I clenched on to silence on some days; I ran from ways to ways – innumerable times, only for you to be able to comprehend the language of my trauma but you were never patient enough with words.

           𝘥𝘦𝘢𝘳 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘳,

          how have you been lately?
          i guess, many things are messed up, scattered here and there and you don’t have the strength to assemble them.
          well, today i thought of telling you, not through a quote, but through this caption, a small piece i am writing, because i’ve been acknowledging the same.
          loving ourselves becomes really tough, sometimes, it seems to be impossible. hearing things from people that shouldn’t matter and effect us, suddenly keeps lingering around our ears, sticking to our minds, telling us we aren’t capable, or worthy.
          self-love is hard, but i try to not fail, because it is something you’ll have tough time building, but once you’ve built it, it’s a treasure worth building.
          if you are feeling empty, lonely and left out, you must remember you have yourself. i agree we need to talk to something, to someone, there are people out there ready to listen. maybe not all, but a few bunch that knows how much it is needed to let our feelings out of the box where it has been suffocating and locked.
          there will be times you’ll feel like crying, tearing apart without any reason, and once you tear up every reason appears. it is when you have to strenghten yourself by crying and letting out the pain, because the more you hold it in, the more it wants to be set free.
          i just want you to know, it’ll pass away, every phase.
          so be strong, keep yourself updated about your feelings, cry when you need to, let it out. share some love with yourself and you’ll be happy.
       </p>

            The sun never fails to astonish me,
            it builds a path full of inspiration,
            when life hits me with stones of
            problems. look up at the sky,
            sun is shining bright, always.
            even during night, it illuminates
            the earth and the moon through
            its light. it hides itself in the
            sheet of darkness but helping
            the moon to shine bright
            by giving its own radiance.
              
            If the moon is reminder of love,
            the sun is reminder of hope.
            even when clouds try to hide
            its potential, it still shines,
            even though we can’t see it.
            that’s what brave bodies do,
            never stop doing their best.
            they do it for themselves,
            not to show others.
            hiding behind the black clouds,
            it never fails to reflect the silver
            lining, because it knows, the
            darkness may hide its potential
            for sometime, but can never take
            away its ability to illuminate
            others life, only if it believes
            in itself. and it does.

         We all are humans and we all go through phases in life that change us, that define us and 
         that helps us to understand what life is all about, but then, there are times when life is rough and 
         is filled with darkness where you don’t really understand what’s happening and you don’t seem to figure out a way 
         to pull yourself out of the darkness. These are the most critical times where we lose ourself if we don’t 
         hold on to the things that helps us to stay sane. And, during these times we don’t have anyone around us to help us and show the light.
